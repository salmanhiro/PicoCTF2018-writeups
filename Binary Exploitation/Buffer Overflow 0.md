I try to overflow the downloaded program, but always said "flag file is missing", even when I try 2^n range characters.

Then I try the shell, and found out: 
1. Try some possible ranges until segmentation fault at 25 chars and figure out if you run

```
./vuln aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
```
it will give you the flag
